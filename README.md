This example demonstrates a subtle issue in VBScript where implicit type conversion during arithmetic operations can lead to unexpected results or errors. The code includes a function that checks for numeric input. However, due to VBScript's flexible type system, attempting to add a number and a string may result in different behaviours depending on the context. The solution file provides a more robust approach to handle this case.
